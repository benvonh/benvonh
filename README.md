## About me...

- 📜 Mechatronics engineering student at **The University of Queensland**, Australia

- ⚙️ Robotics engineer for the **[ExoMotus](https://www.fftai.com/exomotus-m4-2/)** exoskeleton project ([NRM-group](https://github.com/NRM-group), 2022)

- 🤖 **[Robot Operating System 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html)** enthusiast

- 🤝 Integrator of ROS2 in the **[CAN Open Robot Controller](https://github.com/UniMelbHumanRoboticsLab/CANOpenRobotController)** stack

In completing my undergrad degree, I will study for a semester in an exchange program at the **Technical University of Munich**, Germany.

During this time, I hope to explore the robotics industry in Europe and discover my career pathways before graduating with a Master of Engineering in 2024.

## My interests...

- 💻 Programming in C/C++ (Python if I'm feeling lazy)

- 🧠 Machine learning & neural networks

- 🖥️ Linux ricing (NixOS btw)

- ✈️ Travelling abroad if I have money

I am also developing a collection of minimal C++ robotics libraries for easy integration with smaller-sized projects. Check them out here (TODO) if you would like.
