Here is a light demo of the Digital Twin application that I've been developing for a while now. Its goal is to marry the ROS2 world with the Universal Scene Description, much like what NVidia's Omniverse does. This project, however, attempts to be a lighter solution with a focus on smaller niche cases. My hope is that small- to mid-sized teams, looking for an alternative to Digital Twins but still interact with ROS2 and USD, may find this useful in their R&D .

The application is still in the very early stages of development so please consider donating if you are interested in seeing this grow into a more robust Digital Twin. üôè
