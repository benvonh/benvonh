## About me...

- üìú Studying mechatronics engineering at **The University of Queensland**, Australia
- ‚öôÔ∏è Worked as a robotics engineer developing a controller stack for the [ExoMotus](https://www.fftai.com/exomotus-m4-2/) exoskeleton robot
- ü§ñ Experience with the [Robot Operating System (2)](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) and many of the popular packages in the ROS ecosystem
- ü§ù Led the integration of ROS with the [CAN Open Robot Controller](https://github.com/UniMelbHumanRoboticsLab/CANOpenRobotController) framework

In completing my undergrad degree, I will study for a semester in an exchange program at the **Technical University of Munich**, Germany. During that time, I hope to explore Europe and its robotics industry before deciding whether to begin graduate work or continue my studies into a doctorate degree.

## My interests...

- Programming in C/C++
- Machine learning (e.g., CNN)
- Control theory in robotics
- Reading dystopian books
- Personalising my Linux and Neovim environment
- Travelling overseas such as to Japan and Germany

I have also developed a collection of minimalistic C++ robotics libraries for many of my personal projects. Check them out here at [benvonh.github.io](https://benvonh.github.io/index.html).
