## About me...

- 📜 Studying mechatronics engineering at **The University of Queensland**, Australia
- ⚙️ Former robotics engineer for the [ExoMotus](https://www.fftai.com/exomotus-m4-2/) exoskeleton project (@NRM-group)
- 🤖 Experience with the [Robot Operating System](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) and the ROS ecosystem
- 🤝 Led in the integration of ROS with the [CAN Open Robot Controller](https://github.com/UniMelbHumanRoboticsLab/CANOpenRobotController) framework

In completing my undergrad degree, I will study for a semester in an exchange program at the **Technical University of Munich**, Germany. During this time, I hope to explore much of the robotics industry in Europe and decide whether to begin graduate work there or continue my studies onto a doctorate degree.

## My interests...

- 💻 Programming in C/C++
- 🧠 Machine learning (CNN)
- 📚 Reading dystopian books
- 🖥️ Ricing my Arch Linux and Neovim config
- ✈️ Travelling overseas such as to Japan and Germany

I have also developed a collection of minimalistic C++ robotics libraries. If you woudl like, you can check them out here at [benvonh.github.io](https://benvonh.github.io/index.html).
