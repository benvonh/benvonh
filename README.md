## About me...

I am a mechatronics engineering student studying at **The University of Queensland**, Australia. I have worked in robotics for one year now, developing a controller software stack for the [ExoMotus](https://www.fftai.com/exomotus-m4-2/) exoskeleton robot.

In completing my undergrad degree, I will study for a semester in an exchange program with the **Technical University of Munich**, Germany, and explore the European continent before deciding whether to continue with a doctorate or look into industry practice.

## My interests...

- Programming in C/C++
- Machine learning (e.g., CNN)
- Control theory in robotics
- Reading dystopian books
- Travelling to Japan, Germany, etc.
